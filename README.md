# odin-tic-tac-toe

A tic-tac-toe game made entirely in vanilla JavaScript as part of The Odin Project.<br><br>
You can play the game on [GitHub Pages](https://skorzany.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/).<br>
Game for two players, there is no 'AI' opponent <br>
(although it could be implemented with random choices).<br><br>
The goal of the project was to understand the concept of <em>closures</em>, <br>
as well as learning about js design patterns: <em>factory functions</em> <br>
and the <em>module pattern</em> (also called an <em>IIFE</em>).<br>
## Additional notes
Project required careful planning and needed additional work to be <em>cheat-proof</em>:<br>
- game logic had to be separated from the DOM entirely, <br>
so that changing the display using devtools had no effect on the game,
- access to object properties had to be hidden from the outside.<br>
<!--  -->
Although the project requirements did not ask for a responsive layout, <br>
I went ahead and did my best to make it scalable for any screen size.<br>
The color palette is very simple and that is <em>fine</em>, aesthetics was <em>not</em> the focus.<br><br>
I hope you like it!
